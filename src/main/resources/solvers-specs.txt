# For each external solver, specify how to use it within REPETITA
# 
# The definition of each solver must start with an identifier within square brackets.
# It must also include the definition of the following features:
# - name                      Name of the solver
# - run command               Command to run the solver from CLI (use strings '$TOPOFILE' and '$DEMANDFILE' to specify topology and demand files to be taken as input; use string '$OUTFILE' for output file)
# - gettime command           Command to output the time taken by the solver during its last run
# - optimization effect       How to modify the routing configuration according to the output of 'run command' 
# - field separator           The field separator in the output of 'run command' (default ' ', see below for more details)
# - key field                 The field number in the output of 'run command' that has to be used as keys by the optimization effect (default '0', see below for more details)
# - value field               The field number in the output of 'run command' that has to be used as value by the optimization effect (default '1', see below for more details)
# - optimization objective    An integer indicating the solver objective among {0 for 'undefined'; 1 for 'minimize max link utilization'}
# 
# Implemented optimization effect
# - setLinkWeights            Changes IGP link weights from the output of the run command (the key field is the identifier of a link, the value field is the new weight to be set on the given link)
# - setExplicitPaths          Sets explicit paths (e.g., tunnels) from the output of the run command (the key field is the identifier of a demand, the value field is the explicit path to be set for the given demand)
